## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Welcome!

Welcome, and thank you for choosing to help contribute to Yet Another Module Organiser/ Manager!
Yet Another Module Organizer and Manager (YAMOM) is an all-in-one desktop app featuring
a full course catalogue, module search and timetable builder for the National University of Singapore, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface.

This document intends to onboard developers onto YAMOM. We hope to bring you in to fix bugs, or even adding
new features and dimensions to YAMOM!
It gives insights on how the project is set up, the architecture used,
and the code style one should adopt when contributing to the project.

## 2. Setting up

This section describes the development tools used in the creation of YAMOM.

### 2.1. Prerequisites

1. **JDK** 11
2. **IntelliJ** IDEA
3. **Gradle** 6.2

### 2.2. Setting up the project locally

1. **Fork** this repo, and **clone** the fork into your computer.
2. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click **`File`** > **`Close Project`** to close the existing project dialog first).
3. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle  
   a.To set up the correct project structure **`Configure`** > **`Project Defaults`** > **`Project Structure`**  
   b. Under **`New...`** find the directory of the appropriate JDK version.
4. Click **`Import Project`**.
5. Find the **`build.gradle`** file and select it. Click **`OK`**.
6. Click **`Open as Project`**.
7. Click **`OK`** and accept the default settings.

### 2.3. Configure the coding style

In IntelliJ's IDEA we adopt [[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the code style](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html)
to set up IDEAâ€™s coding style to match ours.

> Optionally, you can follow the guide [[se-edu/guides] Using Checkstyle](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html)
> to find how to use the CheckStyle within IDEA e.g., to report problems as you write code.

## 3. Design

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

### 3.1 Architecture

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

Core program flow is managed by the Duke class. The Duke class delegates work to the Ui class to handle user input.

User input is passed to the Parser class to parse the input as a command.

Each command subclass handles its own execution.

<code>Storage</code>: Reads and writes data to the hard disk in a NUSMods export link format.

### 3.2 Model Component

### 3.3 Parser Component

The <code>Parser</code> component can:

- return the correct command type based on user input.

### 3.4 Command Component
The <code>Command</code> component can:
- execute and return the command type based on the first word of the user input.

Below is a table of command subclasses and their respective command type. The different command types extends from the 
Command class and are all in the command package.

[//]: # (if the table is not necessary, remove it)
| Command    | Command Type              | Action                                                                  |
|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `add`      | `AddModuleCommand`        | Adds the user input module into their timetable.                        |
| `delete`   | `DeleteModuleCommand`     | Deletes the user input module from their timetable.                     |
| `help`     | `HelpCommand`             | Displays the help message.                                              |
| `search`   | `SearchModuleCommand`     | Searches the user input module based on code, title, semester or level. |
| `select`   | `SelectSlotCommand`       | Selects the time slot for the different lesson types.                   |
| `semester` | `SelectSemesterCommand`   | Selects the semester that the user want.                                |
| `get`      | `GetCommand`              | Gets all the details with the user input module code.                   |
| `view`     | `ViewCommand`             | Views the user timetable with user's selected modules.                  |
| `bye`      | `ExitCommand`             | Exits the program.                                                      |
| `nil`      | `InvalidCommand`          | Displays the invalid command message.                                   |
| `nil`      | `IncompleteModuleCommand` | Display the incomplete command message.                                 |
| `nil`      | `UnknownCommand`          | Display the unknown command message.                                    |

#### 3.4.1 AddModuleCommand

##### How the feature is implemented
The `AddModuleCommand` class extends the `Command` class.
The constructor `AddModuleCommand()` parses the user `input` module code `.toUpperCase()` as the format to fetch an
instance of `module` from its class. Boolean `successful` field is used to flag successfully added modules in comparison
to instances where it is not possible to add the `module` as it already exists in the `state`'s `selectedModuleList`.
It overrides the `execute()` method from the `Command` class, and updates `successful` accordingly, which will later be
passed on to the overridden `getExecutionMessage()` which displays the result of data validation that new `selectedModule`
added are unique.

##### Why it is implemented this way.
In order to be able to be able to compare the new instance of `selectedModule` created of the module code the user wants to delete,
in the constructor against an instance of the module the user has previously added into the `selectedModuleList`, the `equals()`
method extended from super class `Object` has been overridden to return `true` for instances where `semester` and `module`
(specifically `moduleCode` attribute from the parent class) are the same, allowing us to validate and add the desired module.

##### Alternatives considered.
Initially, data validation was being handled by the `Parser` class, however in the principles of avoiding tight coupling 
and improving cohesion, it was moved back under the `AddModuleCommand` class.

#### 3.4.2 DeleteModuleCommand

##### How the feature is implemented
The `DeleteModuleCommand` class extends the `Command` class.
Similar to `AddModuleCommand` class, the constructor `DeleteModuleCommand()` parses the user `input` module code `.toUpperCase()` as the format to fetch an
instance of `module` from its class. Boolean `successful` field is used to flag successfully added modules in comparison
to instances where it is not possible to add the `module` as it already exists in the `state`'s `selectedModuleList`.
It overrides the `execute()` method from the `Command` class, and updates `successful` accordingly, which will later be
passed on to the overridden `getExecutionMessage()` which displays the result of data validation that the `selectedModule`
instance is only removed from the `selectedModuleList` if it exists.

##### Why it is implemented this way.
In order to be able to be able to compare the new instance of `selectedModule` created of the module code the user wants to delete,
in the constructor against an instance of the module the user has previously added into the `selectedModuleList`, the `equals()`
method extended from super class `Object` has been overridden to return `true` for instances where `semester` and `module`
(specifically `moduleCode` attribute from the parent class) are the same, allowing us to validate and remove the desired module.


##### Alternatives considered.
Once again, data validation was being handled by the `Parser` class, however in the principles of avoiding tight coupling
and improving cohesion, it was moved back under the `DeleteModuleCommand` class.

#### 3.4.3 HelpCommand

#### 3.4.4 SearchModuleCommand

##### How the feature is implemented
The <code>SearchModuleCommand</code> class extends the <code>Command</code> class.
It overrides the <code>execute()</code> method from the <code>Command</code> class.
The <code>execute()</code> method will search for the user input module primarily based on either module code or title,
with additional parameters of semester and level to narrow down the search results.

##### Why it is implemented this way.
User may or may not know the exact module code or title. As such, the user can search for the module based on optional 
parameters such as semester or level. However, the user must input at least the module code or title before additional 
parameters can be added in order to refine the search.

##### Alternatives considered.
We thought of implementing the search feature in a way that the required user for multiple inputs and displaying all the
different results after each input. However, we decided against it as it would be too tedious for the user to input 
multiple times and the search process will be too long.

#### 3.4.5 SelectCommand

#### 3.4.6 SelectSemesterCommand

#### 3.4.7 GetCommand

##### How the feature is implemented
The <code>GetCommand</code> class extends the <code>Command</code> class.
It overrides the <code>execute()</code> method from the <code>Command</code> class.
The <code>execute()</code> method will get all the module details from the user input module code.

##### Why it is implemented this way.
This function was implemented this way as it is the most intuitive way to get the module details. It also displays all
the different lesson types and their respective time slots. However, if the user is planning in a semester that the 
module is not offered, the user will be notified that the module is not offered in the current semester and timings will
not be shown. This is to prevent the user from selecting a time slot that is not offered in the current semester, which 
will reduce the chance of having an error if the user tries to select a time slot of the module that is not offered in 
the current semester.

##### Alternatives considered.
We thought of displaying the full module details from the search results. However, we decided against it as it would be 
too tedious for the user to search for the **exact module code** first before getting the details. The user may
not know the exact module code, which is not very user-friendly and takes up a lot of time just to get the module 
details for 1 module. 

#### 3.4.8 ViewCommand

#### 3.4.9 ExitCommand

#### 3.4.10 InvalidCommand

#### 3.4.11 IncompleteModuleCommand

#### 3.4.12 UnknownCommand

### 3.5 Utils Component

#### 3.5.1 UI Component

The <code>UI</code> component can:
- read input from the user
- store and print out messages to the user

##### Why it is implemented this way
To comply with the Model-View Controller Framework
To separate the internal representations and processing of information from the presentation and acceptance of 
information from the user

##### Alternative Considered
Each component to handle the presentation of information to the user

- Increase coupling between components
- Hard to define the sequence that information being presented to user

#### 3.5.2 Link Component

The <code>Link</code> component can:
- create a [NUSmod](https://nusmods.com/) link to be used in a browser
- Parse a NUSmod link to import modules into YAMOM

##### Why is it implemented this way
To separate out the handling of NUSmod compatibility 

##### Alternative Considered
To implement the handling of export in Storage class and import in Command class

- Increase coupling between components
- Decrease reusability of NUSmod link processing

#### 3.5.3 Storage Component

![Storage Class](..\docs\images\storageClass.png)

The <code>Storage</code> component can:

- read from the hard disk a single line which is supposed to be a NUSMods export link
- save to the hard disk

Different checks have been implemented to ensure that even
if the data file is modified in any way, it would not crash the programme.

##### Why it is implemented this way

To facilitate easy transfer of information from NUSMods to YAMOM.

##### Alternatives considered

Storing as <code>.json</code> file

- would not be readable by the user
- would have to implement another function for export/import function

## 4. Implementation
